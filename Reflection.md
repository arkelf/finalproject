# Final Project Write Up

**Organization:**  Completeing my project was transformed into less of a mad dash with me wondering where my next step was into 
a made dash with direction. I did start on my final project late (the data vis one) but using github to my suprise helped me much like
using an app like Trello. The Issue page was a nice way to remind me what I have to do next and as someone who suffers from ADD, having
a direction is a big help. Also the fact that everything is put in one place saves me from trying to find files later and allows me to
have back-ups if need be. Overall dispite what I would usually do like delete the program from my comuter after the class, I will try 
use git in the future.

**Assesment:**  
* How it helped
  *Helped me organize
  *Gave me a direction
  *saved me time
  *Gave me a back up
  *Easy submition since I had all my files together
*How it didn't
  *I did spend some time on the set up and constant updates

Over all git made it easier to complete

**Reflection:** I've used Trello to organize, and google drive to keep all my files together, but git was more than those two.
Sure I will still use google drive for its free software but git I found improved my project more than I thought it would.
